# Assembly Code Bug: Potential Memory Access Violation

This repository demonstrates a potential memory access violation bug in a short assembly code snippet and provides a solution.

**Bug:** The original assembly code attempts to modify a memory location pointed to by ebx + 0x10 without verifying the memory access is valid.  If ebx + 0x10 points to an invalid address (e.g., outside the process's allocated memory), this will likely lead to a segmentation fault or crash.

**Solution:** The solution demonstrates how to add a check to ensure the memory address is valid before attempting the write operation.  This involves verifying the address is within the bounds of allocated memory or using other appropriate memory safety techniques.
